This project was once used as an example of how to do persistence layer testing in Java in a presentation i did.

It enables test code which looks something like this:

@TestData(filename="StoryDaoTestData.xml")
public class StoryDaoTest extends DaoTest {

        @Autowired StoryDao storyDao;
        
        @Test   
        public void shouldFindStoryById() {
                Story story = storyDao.findById(1l);
                assertEquals(1l, story.getId().longValue());
        }

}
